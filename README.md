The goal of this code is to provide an example of how to call the Mercury Mobile Wallet Hosting Service via an embedded web browser control.  This code uses the .net web browser control.

# PreReqs

The code was written using Visual Studio 2013 and c#.  The code should transfer between visual studio versions but if you want to compile immediately you will need 2013.

#Contents
The solution contains two projects:

1. ALFREDPOS -- a test "pos" that will drive the MpsWidgetHostingControl written in c#.
2. MPSWidgetHostingControl -- this is an activex control that uses the .net web browser control to facilitate a mobile wallet payment.

# Usage

1. Follow the steps in the integration guide to check a customer into a merchant location.
2. Compile the code
3. Run the ALFREDPOS application and click on the mobile wallet button.
4. You should see the customer checked in.
